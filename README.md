# HTML-and-CSS-animation


Here’s a good-level HTML and CSS animation example that combines multiple effects — color transitions, movement, scaling, and rotation. This is more advanced than basic hover effects but still easy to understand and customize.

What it includes:

Smooth animations using @keyframes.

Transformations: scale, translate, rotate.

Color transitions.

Looping animation with infinite.

Responsive design.
